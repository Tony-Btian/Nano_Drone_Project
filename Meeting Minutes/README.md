Meeting Title	Discussion on Project Direction and Topics
Meeting Date	June 6, 2024
Participants	Mahmud Sani Zango, Yuxuan Han
Meeting Content
1.	Discussion on Project Topics
Discussed the use of a swarm of Nano drones by sharing visuals among the drones, 3D graphics are constructed on a host machine. This technology can be applied to various scenarios, such as real-time monitoring and disaster area assessment. 

2.	Application of Dual Vision Cameras
Explored the implementation of object following and obstacle avoidance features in drones using dual vision cameras. This technology enhances the autonomy and safety of drones in complex and dynamically changing environments, making it particularly suitable for tasks in challenging settings. 

3.	Combination of AI and Deep Learning with a Monocular Camera
Discussed the implementation of object following and obstacle avoidance using a monocular camera integrated with AI and deep learning. The advantage of this technology lies in reducing hardware costs while improving recognition and response speeds through algorithm optimization. 

Completed Activities This Week
•	Hardware and software support for Crazyflie drones was studied
•	Research on swarm theory and related essays are examined
•	Research on obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithms
Upcoming Activities – Next Week
•	Research on using MATLAB for drone simulation
•	Building a PyTorch environment
Issues, Risks and Concerns
Nothing
